# Task Management System

Welcome to our Task Management System! This project showcases what we've learned with html, customer CSS, Bootstrap and implemented responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

## Features

- Responsive Navbar: A fixed-top navbar that collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens and implemented visual effects.
- User Profile Dropdown: A dropdown menu accessible from the navbar for user-specific actions such as viewing profile, notifications, tasks, projects, and sign out.
- Sidebar Navigation: A collapsible sidebar with quick links to different sections of the task management system.
- Task Cards: Task cards displaying task details such as deadline, status, priority, and notes. Each card includes options to edit or delete the task.
- Search Functionality: A search bar in the sidebar to quickly find tasks
- Add New Task: A button to add new tasks, with modal support for entering task details.
- Page Navigation: Scrollspy used to navigate user to designated area of the web page.
- Home Page Carousel: Images through a slideshow to showcase ads and other information for a new user to get more information about the site.

## Technologies Used
